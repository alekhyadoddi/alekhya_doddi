                Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey (/ˈrʌtɡərz/), commonly referred to as Rutgers University,
                Rutgers, or RU, is a public research university in New Jersey. It is the largest institution of higher
                education in New Jersey.

                Rutgers was originally chartered as Queen's College on November 10, 1766. It is the eighth-oldest
                college in the United States and one of the nine colonial colleges chartered before the American
                Revolution.[10][11] The college was renamed Rutgers College in 1825[12] in honor of Colonel Henry
                Rutgers.[13] For most of its existence, Rutgers was a private liberal arts college but it evolved into a
                coeducational public research university after being designated "The State University of New Jersey" by
                the New Jersey Legislature in laws enacted in 1945 and 1956.[14]

                Rutgers has three campuses located throughout New Jersey: New Brunswick campus in New Brunswick and
                adjacent Piscataway, the Newark campus, and the Camden campus. The university has additional facilities
                elsewhere in the state.[15] Instruction is offered by 9,000 faculty members in 175 academic departments
                to over 45,000 undergraduate students and more than 20,000 graduate and professional students.[7] The
                university is accredited by the Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools[16] and is a member of
                the Big Ten Academic Alliance,[17] the Association of American Universities[18] and the Universities
                Research Association.[19] The New Brunswick campus was categorized by Howard and Matthew Green in their
                book titled The Public Ivies: America's Flagship Public Universities (2001) as a Public Ivy.[20]
